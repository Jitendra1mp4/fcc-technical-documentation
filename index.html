                The <span>Flexbox</span> Layout (Flexible Box) module (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-flexbox/">W3C
                    Candidate Recommendation</a>> as of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out,
                align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic
                (thus the word “flex”).
            </p>
            <p>
                The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’
                width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display
                devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them
                to prevent overflow.
            </p>
            <p>Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which
                is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack
                flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to
                orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.).
            </p>
            <p class="note">Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and
                small-scale layouts, while the <a
                    href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">Grid</a> layout is intended for
                larger scale layouts.

            <p>
                Since flexbox is a whole module and not a single property, it involves a lot of things including its
                whole set of properties. Some of them are meant to be set on the container (parent element, known as
                “flex container”) whereas the others are meant to be set on the children (said “flex items”).
            </p>
            <p>
                If “regular” layout is based on both block and inline flow directions, the flex layout is based on
                “flex-flow directions”. Please have a look at this figure from the specification, explaining the main
                idea behind the flex layout.</p>

            <p>
                Items will be laid out following either the main axis (from main-start to main-end) or the cross axis
                (from cross-start to cross-end).
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">main axis</span> – The main axis of a flex container is the primary axis along
                    which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on the
                    flex-direction property (see below).</li>
                <li><span class="bold">main-start | main-end</span> – The main axis of a flex container is the primary
                    axis along which flex items are laid out. Beware, it is not necessarily horizontal; it depends on
                    the flex-direction property (see below).</li>
                <li><span class="bold">main size</span> – A flex item’s width or height, whichever is in the main
                    dimension, is the item’s main size. The flex item’s main size property is either the ‘width’ or
                    ‘height’ property, whichever is in the main dimension.</li>
                <li><span class="bold"> cross axis</span> – The axis perpendicular to the main axis is called the cross
                    axis. Its direction depends on the main axis direction.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">cross start | cross end</span> – Flex lines are filled with items and placed into
                    the container starting on the cross-start side of the flex container and going toward the cross-end
                    side.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">cross size</span> – The width or height of a flex item, whichever is in the cross
                    dimension, is the item’s cross size. The cross size property is whichever of ‘width’ or ‘height’
                    that is in the cross dimension.</li>

                    <p>
                        This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex
                        context for all its direct children.
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>.container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
}</pre>
                </code>
                    <p>
                        Note that CSS columns have no effect on a flex container.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="property-container">

                    <p>

                        This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex
                        container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of
                        flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>.container {

                        <li>column: same as row but top to bottom
                        </li>
                        <li>column-reverse: same as row-reverse but bottom to top</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the
                        items to wrap as needed with this property.
                    </p>
                    <code>

                        <li>nowrap (default): all flex items will be on one line </li>
                        <li>wrap: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom. </li>
                        <li> wrap-reverse: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top.
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        This is a shorthand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the
                        flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap.
                    </p>

                        This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover
                        when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their
                        maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the
                        line.

                            the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all
                            the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against
                            the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has
                            its own spacing that applies.</li>

                    <p>
                        Note that that browser support for these values is nuanced. For example, space-between never got
                        support from some versions of Edge, and start/end/left/right aren’t in Chrome yet. MDN <a
                            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content">has detailed
                            charts</a>. The safest values are <span class="monospace">flex-start, flex-end, and
                            center</span>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are also two additional keywords you can pair with these values: <span
                            class="monospace">safe</span> and <span class="monospace">unsafe</span>. Using safe ensures
                        that however you do this type of positioning, you can’t push an element such that it renders
                        off-screen (e.g. off the top) in such a way the content can’t be scrolled too (called “data
                        loss”).
                    </p>

                        This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the <span
                            class="bold">cross axis</span> on the current line. Think of it as the <span
                            class="monospace">justify-content</span> version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the

                            start of the cross axis. The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the

                        keywords can be used in conjunction with all the rest of these keywords (although note browser
                        support), and deal with helping you prevent aligning elements such that the content becomes
                        inaccessible.</p>

                <div class="property-container">

                        to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.

                        The behavior could be thought of as a minimum gutter, as if the gutter is bigger somehow
                        (because of something like justify-content: space-between;) then the gap will only take effect
                        if that space would end up smaller.

                        It is not exclusively for flexbox, gap works in grid and multi-column layout as well.

                    <p>By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the
                        order in which they appear in the flex container.
                    </p>
                    <code>

                    <p>
                        This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that
                        serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container
                        the item should take up.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed
                        equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, that child would take up twice
                        as much of the space either one of the others (or it will try, at least). Negative numbers are
                        invalid.</p>

                    <p>
                        This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.
                        Negative numbers are invalid.
                    </p>
                    <code>

                    <p>
                        This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be
                        a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means “look at my width or height
                        property” (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content
                        keyword means “size it based on the item’s content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so
                        it’s hard to test and harder to know what its brethren max-content, min-content, and fit-content
                        do.
                    </p>
                    <code>

                    <p>
                        If set to 0, the extra space around content isn’t factored in. If set to auto, the extra space
                        is distributed based on its flex-grow value. <a

                    <p>
                        This is the shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis combined. The second and third
                        parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. The default is 0 1 auto, but if you set it
                        with a single number value, like flex: 5;, that changes the flex-basis to 0%, so it’s like
                        setting flex-grow: 5; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0%;.
                    </p>
                    <code>
<pre>.item {
  flex: none | [ 'flex-grow' 'flex-shrink'>? || 'flex-basis'> ]
}</pre>

                    <span class="bold">
                        It is recommended that you use this shorthand property
                    </span> rather than set the individual properties. The shorthand sets the other values
                    intelligently.

            </header>
            <p>Flexbox requires some vendor prefixing to support the most browsers possible. It doesn’t just include
                prepending properties with the vendor prefix, but there are actually entirely different property and
                value names. This is because the Flexbox spec has changed over time, creating an <a
                    href="https://css-tricks.com/old-flexbox-and-new-flexbox/">“old”, “tweener”, and “new”</a> versions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Perhaps the best way to handle this is to write in the new (and final) syntax and run your CSS through
                <a href="https://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/">Autoprefixer</a>, which handles the fallbacks very well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, here’s a Sass @mixin to help with some of the prefixing, which also gives you an idea of
                what kind of things need to be done:
            </p>
            <code>
<pre>.item @mixin flexbox() {
    display: -webkit-box;
    display: -moz-box;
    display: -ms-flexbox;
    display: -webkit-flex;
    display: flex;
 }
 
 @mixin flex($values) {
   -webkit-box-flex: $values;
   -moz-box-flex:  $values;
   -webkit-flex:  $values;
   -ms-flex:  $values;
   flex:  $values;
   }
@mixin order($val) {
  -webkit-box-ordinal-group: $val;  
  -moz-box-ordinal-group: $val;     
  -ms-flex-order: $val;     
  -webkit-order: $val;  
  order: $val;
  }
  
  .wrapper {
  @include flexbox();
  }

  @include flex(1 200px);
  @include order(2);

                <p>Flexbox is certainly not without its bugs. The best collection of them I’ve seen is Philip Walton and
                    Greg Whitworth’s <a href="https://github.com/philipwalton/flexbugs">Flexbugs</a>. It’s an
                    open-source place to track all of them, so I think it’s best to just link to that.</p>
